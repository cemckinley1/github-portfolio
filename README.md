# Project: Investigate a Relational Database

## Project Overview
In this project, I queried a database called the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.
